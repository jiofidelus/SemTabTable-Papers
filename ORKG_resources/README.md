## Framework for documenting SemTab@ISWC papers using Open Research Knowledge Graph
To annotate SemTab@ISWC research papers, we used Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a scholarly Knowledge Graph (KG). In this document the resources used
are presented. These are ORKG templates and ORKG comparisons tables. In addition to the links to these resources, we present their description and 
how to cite in case they are used in publications.

### Templates
Templates are conceptual models for documenting papers related to a research problem. It group a set of properties that can be used to compare 
research papers treating the same subject. The following templates were used to create this framework.

| N° | Templates | Link | Description | How to cite |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | SemTab challenge | https://orkg.org/template/R285353 | This template is used to describe all the SemTab challenges described in the summary papers.It summarizes research contributions at the organization point of view. |
| 2 | SemTab round | https://orkg.org/template/R286070| Used to describe the different rounds: tasks demanded, datasets, etc.  |
| 3 | Tabular dataset description |  | Used to describe the datasets published by SemTab@ISWC each year |
| 4 | SemTab system |  | Used to document the different systems proposed by researchers for Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph Matching |
| 5 | [Tabular data description](https://orkg.org/template/R285976) | --- | --- | --- |
